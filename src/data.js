"But wait," I hear you protest, "it’s not like the browser can talk to stuff I have plugged in to my USB ports!". Ah! But it can!<br/><br/>The new WebUSB spec has arrived, and is already supported in at least one browser today. The previous hacks of connecting browsers to robots and other hardware will soon be a thing of the past. WebUSB as a first class API citizen opens up some great opportunities to create new and delightful experiences with robotics.<br/><br/>I’ll introduce you to the WebUSB API, its history, and compare it to previous ’hacks’ to demonstrate why this is such a big deal for you, as a web developer. There will be real hardware shown on stage ready to inspire you to think outside of the box of what browsers are really meant to be used for.'

      talkAbstract:
        'As an instructor of front-end software engineering, I’ve seen first-hand how difficult it is for new developers to navigate call stacks and decrypt error messages. We have built a culture that considers effective error handling a secondary priority, which has a significant impact on those who are just learning to code. Debugging is a huge part of the development process, and the less time we have to spend spinning our wheels, fighting an error message, the more time we have to get back to the fun stuff.<br/><br/>The more experience we have in engineering, the better we get at debugging broken code. We learn how to isolate the problem, decode cryptic error messages, and figure out the most effective terms to research. The faster we develop these skills, the faster we lose our perspective on what it’s like to be a beginner. It’s only when we watch others struggle through these experiences that it becomes obvious just how ineffective our error handling is. Let’s explore the shortcomings of the current state of error handling and how we can improve upon this to make engineering friendlier for newcomers.<br/><br/>This talk is applicable to developers of all skill-levels working with JavaScript. I hope to enlighten engineers on how to create more effective error handling for juniors, and also demonstrate how new developers are currently navigating the choppy waters we’ve presented them with when things go wrong.'

The goal of the "speed run" is to give the audience as much knowledge about generative art as possible in the given time, while also showing the tooling, and surprisingly few steps it takes to get creating unique and original art. Generally speaking, there is no limitation to the audience of this talk, it really sits on the borderlines of people who enjoy art, code and science, and everyone will take home a different piece of that puzzle.<br/><br/>The talk shows both the simplicity and beauty of generative art, with just a few lines of code, we can put the computer to work creating millions of unique pieces.'

      talkAbstract:
        'In 2017, companies globally spent $80B on digital advertising—web pages and mobile apps—delivering ads to billions of users, trillions of times. The majority of these ads were rendered in JavaScript environments. Technically, the challenge for JS developers is to instantaneously find the perfect match between an advertiser and a user, regardless of the website, app, or user profile. This is fun. But economically, we’ve been incentivized to create a global delivery mechanism for arbitrary code onto every connected device, without a care for user experience. It’s the world’s largest, and spammiest, Trojan Horse, and JS developers created it.<br/><br/>(1) Construction — What does this Trojan Horse look like at a technical level? This section covers JavaScript constructs that are really unique to ad-tech, including the rise and anatomy of the “ad tag”, creating sandboxes for arbitrary markup, cookie tracking and pixel syncing, and the impression beacon.<br/><br/>(2) Payload — What kinds of undesirable things are being delivered to publisher properties, and onto our devices? This section goes beyond specific examples of ad quality issues, sniffing, tracking, and malware, also looking at a longer-term invasion happening beneath our feet: have content creators begun trading clicks for a kind of dystopian digital future where ad blockers are simply common sense?<br/><br/>(3) Inversion — What can we as JS developers do about all this? This section argues that we have the power to change ad technology from a Trojan Horse into a powerful message delivery system, one that allows the coexistence of free content, advertising, and delightful user experiences. Ethical and optimistic developers will be the Trojan Horse inside the Trojan Horse.'

I think the stumbling blocks I come across (and overcome) in this project would be useful for others who find themselves in my position.

We can improve these algorithms by looking at the problem from a different perspective - looking at the context of messages as well as the content, and applying linguistic analyses.<br/><br/>For my masters thesis in linguistics I’m studying how we can apply this approach to improve existing NLP algorithms. In this talk I’ll discuss the current blockers in identifying harassment online, and show some ways we can get around them.

        "Chrome Developer Tools is magical. It lets you record network traffic, step through code, modify the DOM, and more! To learn when we would use each of these features, I'll walk you through my adventures trying to trick Taylor Swift’s website into giving me concert tickets. Instead of reading through all of the JS files in her site and scrolling through hundreds of useless network activity logs, I learned how to use XHR breakpoints, filter network activity by type and domain, and recreate requests with CURL. I'll show you all of these tools and a few other tricks, and by the end of this talk, you will know how to reverse engineer any website and manipulate it to do your bidding."

It is already making my life easier.<br /><br/>In this talk, I’ll not only present live examples of CSS Grid used in production with examples of the different syntax, but I’ll also go over a bit of its backstory, its similarities and differences from Flexbox, and why unlike it's sibling Flexbox, its ready to use right away. I’ll show step by step how you can progressively enhance your site with CSS Grid and either write a bulletproof fallback for older browsers, or still use your existing grid framework as a fallback (yes, even Bootstrap), all with pure CSS, no JavaScript required!"

Maybe it didn’t consider edge cases? Maybe the components in the mockup look different from the components in your pre-built design system? Maybe you’re not sure whether it has to be pixel perfect?<br/><br/>Communication is hard. Collaboration is hard. Strong relationships between design and engineering teams are the foundation for building a strong product. This talk will cover strategies for more effective interdisciplinary communication. This is a talk for both engineers and designers, showing a little bit of each other’s world to foster empathy and understanding for the other discipline while providing practical considerations for day to day communication challenges.'

Fast is important. <br /><br />Fonts are part of the critical request chain. If you’re not paying attention to your fonts beyond merely slapping up a Google Fonts link tag, you might be missing some big opportunities to speed things up. Stuff like preloading fonts, using font-display to render fallback text faster, more creative sub-setting choices, and electing to avoid non-essential typefaces specifically for users on limited data plans.

What tools and techniques are they using, and how will that affect your design?<br/><br/>I’ll show you the effects of different assistive tools for low-vision on a sample site, including text resizing and high-contrast themes. You’ll learn a range of simple yet effective CSS techniques to help your sites cope with those effects, such as proportional units and transparent borders. These techniques can be used by front-enders with CSS skills ranging from beginner to expert. After this talk you’ll be confident in your ability to make any good visual design more user-friendly for people using vision-support tools."

Whatever the reason, color remains a contentious but often critical part of design.<br/><br/>I’ll be sharing my journey into color, from the technical challenges to how people respond to it. We’ll take a look at the efforts required in updating large scale web applications like Github, challenges in programatically generating colors, creating color naming conventions, color accessibility, and testing the interaction of color with other parts of a design system.'

However, we continue to raise up and legitimise certain paths over others, implicitly deciding who gets to be a developer of CSS or Javascript. That language then feeds into job postings and wider perceptions of what it is to write CSS, what it is to write Javascript (or even Javascript frameworks), and the legitimacy of different learning paths. From this, we create hierarchies and draw lines which result in different pay scales and fluctuating perceptions of the code we write. This threatens to devalue inclusivity work, and the development community as a whole— let’s learn about the unconventional paths into development and consciously pull away from the damaging hierarchies we create. Let’s celebrate these journeys instead!'

      talkAbstract:
        "New kid on the 'compile-to-JavaScript' block is ReasonML, a syntax layer and toolchain for OCaml, brought to you by the creator of React.js. While there has been a steadily-increasing buzz around ReasonML since the release of ReasonReact by Facebook in March 2017, it's hard to know from the outside whether the hype is truly deserved, or a product of savvy marketing and social media management. More importantly, why should you, as a JavaScript developer care? Aren't compile-to-JS alternatives created for people who don't like JavaScript? <br /><br /> The relationship between ML languages and some of our more popular JavaScript libraries is more than cursory. Scratch the surface of one of our main JavaScript type systems, Flow, and you'll find OCaml. The original prototype of React.js was created in another ML language (SML/ Standard-ML). The JavaScript Redux library is based on Elm's reducer architecture. <br /><br /> While the ReasonML creator has stated his original intent was to fix the top 15 things in the OCaml syntax that annoyed experienced OCaml developers, the result ended up looking a lot like... JavaScript! In this brief exploration of the syntax and the growing community that supports it, one aspect does become abundantly clear. ReasonML and ReasonReact have evolved with the JavaScript community forefront in mind."

        "How is a UI component library the 'Mise en place' of the modern Web-Chef’s kitchen?",
      talkAbstract:
        "Do you need help convincing your team or wider company they’d benefit from creating a living style guide and UI component library? Or getting buy in on why the one you’ve started is a good idea? Let’s run through a fun analogy comparing how having a design system and building a front-end component library is like the essential afternoon preparation session in a high performing kitchen known as ‘Mise en place’. You’ll learn how to explain how having this in place seperates the amatures from the professionals in kitchens around the world, and will ensure that by the time users walk in the virtual door, the dev kitchen is operating at high speed with grace, and no one’s left waiting, grumpily staring down the wait-staff with their best evil-eyes. <br /><br />This talk will benefit you regardless of what level you're at. You’ll come away with a new way to explain to your technical and non-technical stakeholders why you and your team should be given the go ahead to support the successful fast paced delivery of features and products for your users. Don’t sit back and say ‘I told you so’ when things slow to crawl and you're all tangled in legacy code and specifity wars with your heavy CSS. Instead, come and learn a new way to frame the argument to ensure you’ve given everyone the best chance to realise what you already know to be true, before it’s too late."

      talkAbstract:
        "Code without tests is code that is going to sneak up behind you while you’re texting on your phone, put glue in your hair and steal your lucky horseshoe from your bag. Evil! But how can you find those dastardly lines? Traditionally we’ve used test coverage metrics (e.g. Istanbul) to track down those villains but coverage has a lot of gaps. A test can execute 100% of code without performing any assertions, giving you a false sense of security. <br /><br /> What's the solution then? Fight back against those villains by unleashing mutants! Don't worry, you don't have to drink radioactive coolaid, we're talking about mutation testing. It involves using a tool like StrykerJS to programatically insert bugs (mutants) into your code and check whether the tests catch them. Having 100% test coverage is a noble goal but ultimately not very useful as it says nothing about the test suite's ability to catch bugs. On the other hand, having a 100% mutant kill score is a big deal. It means that your assertions can effectively pick up most potential bugs. <br /><br /> Next time your manager asks for a risk analysis of the company's test suite, you'll know what to do: call in the mutants!"

        "Programmers are artists. I am a web animator, developer, and artist. I come from A Fine Arts background, and a question I often get asked is how and why did you become a developer if you come from an arts background? For me, programming is creative, and I would like to share my journey with you. How I brought my diverse background to the developer community and what I am doing with that now. How I relate to technology with its subject matter, medium, and process. Using coding as an artistic medium references and also pushes the boundaries of what art is and can do. Painting and drawing come with such a historical background. <br /><br /> By bringing the old medium into technology - a new medium, a tool that we as people are involved with day to day excites me, it brings new possibilities for css and javascript and the technology space. <br /><br /> Common themes I explore in my art practice is popular culture, and the real and the imaginary. Recently, I have been working at converting my practice (painting, drawings) into a large human sized 3D animation world. <br /><br /> By combing Art and technology together, challenges the notions of the digital world and also how we perceive art and the 'artist'"

      talkAbstract:
        "Users expect real-time data. They want their banking transaction notifications now. Their order confirmed now. They want their user experience to feel—connected. The world has moved to push and users are waiting for the data-driven experiences we create on the web to catch up. <br /><br /> GraphQL is Facebook’s response to this challenge and it is quickly proving itself as an exciting alternative to RESTful APIs for a wide range of contexts. GraphQL is a query language that provides a clean and simple syntax for consumers to interrogate your APIs. These queries are strongly typed, hierarchical and enable clients to retrieve only the data they need. <br /><br /> In addition to the familiar pull based request-response pattern, GraphQL provides a mechanism for clients to subscribe to real-time updates in the form of Subscriptions. Subscriptions are exciting as they represent the core ability we need to satisfy the connected push based experience that our users demand. <br /><br />  In this talk, we will take a hands-on look at GraphQL and see how it can be used to build real-time APIs that are a joy to use. Additionally, we will see how we can integrate a React client with GraphQL using Relay Modern, Facebook's JavaScript framework for building data driven applications. By the end of the session you will understand what is required to craft a compelling real-time user experience with GraphQL, and have the knowledge to deliver on these requirements."

We’ll dip into what makes it ‘smart’ — good feedback and hints to help students understand why their code doesn’t work the way they expected.

      talkAbstract:
        'To our wonderful users the web-app looked fine. It had a nice UI, a tonne of useful features, and mostly seemed to work. But our team of two engineers knew the truth - the app was a mess. Bug fixes that should be simple eluded us. Features that should have taken 2 weeks took 2 months. And users started telling us the app was crashing their browser (it turns out we were leaking memory and the tab was using over 2GB!). This talk shares the story of how I joined a start-up that in its 3 short years had already accumulated a tonne of technical debt - and how my fellow engineer and I took a 50,000 line code base of unstructured jQuery, untyped Angular, and a bunch of scary Grunt tasks, and turned it into a well structured React App, using Webpack to handle our assets and split our bundle, MobX to simplify our page interactions, Flow to add type safety to our code piece by piece, and Jest to test it all. And also how we dealt with those nasty memory leaks using Chrome dev tools so the app stopped crashing. Just as importantly - I’ll share the secrets of how we convinced the non-technical management team that this massive investment was worth it, and had them excited about paying down technical debt. If you have a codebase you’re ashamed to let other engineers look at, if you’re looking at a code-cleanup that feels like it’ll be an insurmountable task, if you are sick of dealing with code that has names like “AbstractModuleDataStrategy” that don’t mean anything, and maybe don’t even do anything, and you’re not even sure anymore, then this is the talk for you. We will map a path out of the spaghetti. Or if you have it all together and always write beautiful, maintainable, well structured code and would like to come and laugh at me and my horror stories, this may also be the talk for you.'

However as a weird mix of content strategist, UX designer and former poker player my smug job-secure world was thrown upside down by the success of the Libratus poker AI in January of this year - the first to comprehensively beat multiple poker professionals over a series of four days. If you’re wondering what poker has to do with design - the answer is a lot! In this talk I’ll cover why the mix of probability, pattern-matching, human behaviour and context in poker strategy is a good model for design, how game theory in poker strategy might be used to ‘solve’ design (and possibly front-end dev!), where design AI efforts are at, and why we should stop treating AI like a digital butler and start imagining the tools of the future - even it if puts you out of a job."
