        CSSConf AU is dedicated to providing a harassment-free conference
        experience for everyone, regardless of gender, gender identity and
        expression, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body
        size, race, age or religion. We do not tolerate harassment of conference
        participants in any form. Sexual language and imagery is not appropriate
        for any conference venue, including talks. Conference participants
        violating these rules may be sanctioned or expelled from the conference
        without a refund at the discretion of the conference organisers.

        <strong>
          If a participant engages in harassing behaviour, event organisers

          environment for all participants.

        rules at all event venues and event-related social activities. We think
        people should follow these rules outside event activities too!

      <Headline>Inclusive language</Headline>
      <p>
        In our commitment to a harassment-free and inclusive environment we
        strongly believe it's important to pay attention to harmful language
        patterns.
      </p>

      <HeadlineSmall>Ableism</HeadlineSmall>
      <p>
        Words like "crazy", "dumb", "insane" or "lame" are examples of{' '}
        <strong>ableist language</strong>, devaluating people who have physical
        or mental disabilities. Its appearance often stems not from any
        intentional desire to offend, but from our innate sense of what it means
        to be normal. These words can be avoided by using more fitting, clearer
        descriptions of what we want to communicate.
      </p>
      <p>
        To find out more about ableism and replacement terms please read{' '}

          this guide
        </LinkThemed>.
      </p>

      <HeadlineSmall>Sexism</HeadlineSmall>
      <p>
        Using gendered terms like <i>"dude"</i> or <i>"guys"</i> to address a
        mixed-gendered group of people contributes to furthering exclusion of
        underrepresented individuals. We strongly advise avoiding gendered
        pronouns as well as gendered terms.{' '}
